1.) Some form of puzzle-platformer using right trigger to unlock more areas. Possibly also top-down.
2.) Bike idea. Graduate from training wheels up to rad bmxing and unicycle. Physics-based, qwoppish.

3.) Pilot plane. Pilot is trying to prevent crash, other players on phone are trying to crash.
a.) Pilot's view, at least intrument panel. Potentially smaller windows for top-down or side view.
b.) Phone/Tablet view - Apps
	i.) Facebook
	--Just a screenshot + buttons?
	--Scrolling through page?
	--Different friends?
	ii.) Twitter
	--Scrolling through feed
	--Replying

	iii.) Google
	iv.) instagram
	v.) take pictures
	vi.) (angry birds? - furious fowls)
	vii.) (calculator maybe?)
	viii.) Set an alarm? Cockpit maybe? Or perhaps specific activity? Every 30 seconds? Noise type dictates alarm behavior.

Plane view:
1.) Spinny meters that can go into red.
2.) Horizon meter.
3.) Buttons that are on/off with light
4.) Switches that are on/off with light?
5.) Indicators of error with rotating switches
6.) Two-phase buttons, require phone users to find the first option first, the second option second.
7.) Stick-switches.
8.) Toilet fault
9.) Altitude is health of plane
10.) 

Ideas:
1.) Pics for instagram are stock photos? Or people? Picking the filter does one thing or another.
2.) Different actions are wired up randomly at start, but identically for all clients.
3.) Actions are a function of a widget, depending on widget type, input value will be analog or digital.
4.) Phones may summon satellites/spaceships/aliens?

Widgets:
1.) http://www.iradis.org/projects/virtualpanels/overhead.gif
2.) Displays
    a.) Altimeter
    b.) Horizon (Maybe phone can alter, affects autopilot?)
    c.) Compass
    d.) Climb/Level meter
    e.) Fuel Level
    f.) Oil Pressure
    g.) Hydrolic pressure
    h.) Radio frequency
    i.) Temperature (causes wings to freeze? Or instruments to be off?)
    j.) Air speed indicator
    h.) Battery faults
3.) Buttons
    a.) Auto-pilot on
    b.) Fuel dump (possibly a slow dump, disabled by pilot pressing the button.)
    c.) Fire chute (pull graphic?)
    d.) Call stewardess (pilot-only, blinks yellow when available)
    e.) Fire extiguishers (per engine, possibly locked - will disable an engine if both unlocked and hit).
    f.) Toilet fault?
    g.) Engine enable/disable
    h.) Eject?
    i.) Air brakes
    j.) Equipment cooling
    k.) Cabin defogger?    
    l.) Normalize hydrolic pressure (denormalize if already normalized)
    m.) Normalize oil pressure (denormalize if already normalized)
    n.) Landing gear
    o.) Lights
4.) Dials
    a.) Flaps
    b.) Temperature control (indoors and out?)    
    c.) Wipers enabled - fast/slow/off, left and right.
    d.) Battery Power Source (if batteries get disabled)
    e.) Radio frequency set
    f.) Autopilot direction
    g.) Circuit breaker
5.) Steering (Pitch/Yaw)
6.) Throttle

Server:
1.) Makes a map for each session of inputs to behaviors/buttons?
2.) Clients only inform server of action performed, server dictates what that action actually means.
3.) Relays that change to cockpit - cockpit is just a different client for the server.

Tasks:
1.) Phone client
    a.) Desktop for accessing 'apps'.
    b.) Apps themselves
        i.) Headtome - facebook
        ii.) Instagram
        iii.) Safari with Google.
        iv.) Wikipanion?
        v.) Some game? - Angry Birds, Words with Friends
        vi.) Tooter - Twitter
        vii.) 
    c.) How do these play into the main thing?
2.) Side view/top view.
    a.) Bearing and crashy.
    b.) Would make chute visible.
3.) Button graphics
    a.) Text
4.) Dial graphics
    b.) Text
5.) Work out actual information types.
    a.) What the buttons mean, what the behavior of the buttons is.
    b.) Do they all just contribute to a joint unhealth, or do they affect things directly?
6.) Work out actual plane logic.
    a.) Lift, drag, thrust, weight.
7.) Grid arrangement of pieces for pilot.
